# IMAGObot
Robotic platform for in situ bioprinting based on LinuxCNC

IMAGObot is a biofabrication platform developed starting from the open-source robot MOVEo from BCN3D (https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo). This robot was re-engineered to be used for in situ bioprinting (biomaterial desposition directly inside the patient) applications. The original project was modified replacing the gripper with a syringe-pump extrusion module (extrusion-based-bioprinting) and each axis was equipped with optical encoders. The electronics is completely based on LinuxCNC.

In this repository all the .stl files to built the robot and all the configurations files for LinuxCNC are collected.
LinuxCNC configurations file can be used as a reference point for the testing of gcode generated by third parties for this 5 DoF robotic platform.
