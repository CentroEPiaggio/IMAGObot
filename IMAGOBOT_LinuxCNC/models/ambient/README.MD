Here you can add a static object to the main scene.
Each Stl or Obj file located in this directory will be imported into the main scene.

Some rules to follow:

- Only Ascii STL or Ascii Obj are supported
- The model will be loaded in the scene with the same coordinates of the original file
- You can define a color for the model, RGB value can be set in the file name:
  example 3plate_rgb:255:0:0:255.stl , import the '3plate' model in red color
