The IMAGObot configuration is a set of files that makes up a very basic LinuxCNC simulation using
ini, tbl, var. It is very similar to the sim config template, yet with 5 rotary joints defined.

The IMAGObot configuration has been tested with a real 5 DoF robotic arm (stl files to built the robot in the repository).

  If you change the HOME location in TRAJ, make sure you change the appropiate HOME locations of the AXES
