The Moveo configuration is a set of files that makes up a very basic LinuxCNC simulation using
ini, tbl, var. It is very similar to the sim config template, yet with 5 joints defined.

The Moveo configuration was originally based on the Puma560 configuration but is UNTESTED against a real Moveo arm.
